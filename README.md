i am iluvsoup

contrary to popular belief i do not like all kinds of soup\
tomato soup can be very good but some variants are, to put it simply, gross.\
theres this good soup with salmon and shrimp and stuff\
i very much enjoy that one

## current projects
procrastinating

## things i like
### blender
i use blender for 3d modelling work and making some fun renders once in a while\
i find it strangely theraputic to sit down and model a damn hamburger or something, i am by no means experienced though.

### linux
i like the penguin\
its my favor ite

### video games
some of my favorite video games include little nightmares 1 & 2 and persona 5.\

### music
i like listening to video game soundtracks, but bands like sir chloe are good aswellðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤

### sorting algorithms
some people may argue that they are boring but i argue that some people are wrong\
if you like bubble sort you are lying

here are my favorite sorting algorithms (in no particular order):
- stalin sort
- bogosort
- [pancake](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uFeGl428_QY/maxresdefault.jpg) sort (just cuz i like pancakes)

### programming & game development
i enjoy programming, i'd even go as far as to say it's my passion.\
i can't really explain it, but i just love *making* things. whenever i play a game or visit a website, i can't help but wonder: "how is that made?".\
i love seeing the inner workings of things, i love decompiling games and looking at the source code because sometimes i forget that there are actual people behind the games that i play.

i have a lot of experience with lua and roblox studio, and i've dabbled in python.\
i am currently learning javascript (better late than lever ig)

recently i've gotten into web dev with svelte, and so far it's been really refreshing.
