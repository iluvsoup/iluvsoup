i am iluvsoup *(and very proud i got to take this username before another soup-loving mortal took it)*

contrary to popular belief i do not like all kinds of soup\
tomato soup can be very good but some variants are, to put it simply, gross.\
if i had to pick a favorite it'd probably be potato soup or chicken soup

mm theres this good soup with salmon and shrimp and stuff i get once in a while\
i very much enjoy that one

## current projects
procrastinating

## things i like (other than soup)
### blender
i use blender for 3d modelling work and making some fun renders once in a while\
i find it strangely theraputic to sit down and model a damn hamburger or something\
i am by no means experienced, having only used it seriously the past few months.

### linux
i like the penguin\
its my favor ite

### sorting algorithms
some people may argue that they are boring but i argue that some people are wrong\
what sorting algorithm is your favorite says a lot about you as a person.\
if you like bubble sort i will publicly execute you

here are my favorite sorting algorithms (in no particular order):
- stalin sort
- bogosort
- [pancake](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uFeGl428_QY/maxresdefault.jpg) sort (just cuz i like pancakes)

thnx

### programming & game development
i enjoy programming, i'd even go as far as to say it's my passion.\
i've been interested in it ever since i was like 7 years old, although at that time i mostly used scratch (GOAT).

at around 9 i discovered roblox studio. i had already been playing roblox for a while but i had never tried making a game of my own.\
roblox studio uses lua-u (lua with some cool features), this was a good introduction for me to *"real"* programming languages.
i had absolutely no experience, but after a while i got a hang of it. i still use roblox studio to make stuff today, but i'm not that interested in making games. i much  prefer making cool projects with algorithms such as marching cubes or just messing around with api's.

i like recreating small games like snake or minesweeper in the console, keeps me entertained in school.\
i am most experienced in lua, but i know a fair bit of python and i know how to output hello world in javascipt.\
languages i want to learn include Rust (i like the crab), javascript, c++, c, c# and maybe even swift for ios apps in case i ever want to do that.

i absolutely DESPISE web, sorry nerds\
i also do not like using 1000000 frameworks and libraries just to print hello world *cough cough javascript cough cough python*

### python (hating on it)
i hate python\
fight me

python has no use except for blender plugins\
fr fr bogosort in lua can sort an array with a length of 10^10 instantly while python never even finishes üôÑüôÑüôÑ trash language\
also like whyü§îü§î is it called python like omg python snake is venomous meaning that python [kills](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Python_molurus_molurus_2.jpg/640px-Python_molurus_molurus_2.jpg) peopleüßêüßê
