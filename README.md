i am iluvsoup *(and very proud i got to take this username before another soup-loving mortal took it)*

contrary to popular belief i do not like all kinds of soup\
tomato soup can be very good but some variants are, to put it simply, gross.\
if i had to pick a favorite it'd probably be potato soup or chicken soup

mm theres this good soup with salmon and shrimp and stuff i get once in a while\
i very much enjoy that one

## things i like (other than soup)
### blender
i use blender for 3d modelling work and making some fun renders once in a while\
i find it strangely theraputic to sit down and model a damn hamburger or something\
i am by no means experienced, having only used it seriously the past few months.

### linux
i like the penguin\
its my favor ite

### sorting algorithms
some people may argue that they are boring but i argue that some people are wrong\
what sorting algorithm is your favorite says a lot about you as a person.\
if you like bubble sort i will publicly execute you

here are my favorite sorting algorithms (in no particular order):
- stalin sort
- bogosort
- [pancake](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uFeGl428_QY/maxresdefault.jpg) sort (just cuz i like pancakes)

thnx

### python (hating on it)
i hate python\
fight me

python has no use except for blender plugins\
fr fr bogosort in lua can sort an array with a length of 10^10 instantly while python never even finishes 🙄🙄🙄 trash language\
also like why🤔🤔 is it called python like omg python snake is venomous meaning that python kills people🧐🧐
